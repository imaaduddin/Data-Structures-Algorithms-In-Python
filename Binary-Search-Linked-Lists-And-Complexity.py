# Question 1: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays
# them out face down in sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning 
# over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

# Systematic Strategy To Apply For Solving Problems:
# 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
# 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
# 3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
# 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
# 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identity inefficiencies, if any.
# 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
